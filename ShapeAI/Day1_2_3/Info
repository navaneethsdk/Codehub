Arrays are Cache friendly
Arrays are of 2 types : Fixed arrays and Dynamic arrays
Fixed Arrays are stored in stack 
Dyanmic arrays in Cpp are caalled vectors
Array declarations:
--int arr[n];
--string arr[n];
Vector declarations:
--#include<vectors>
--vector<int> arr;
--vector<string> arr(n); //may or may not mention size
all data in vector are initialized as zero by default
